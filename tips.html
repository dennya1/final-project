  <h1>
    Tips for All
  </h1>
  Sometimes some tips just don't work and you need to find a different one to try.
  It has been proven over and over again that people just think differently.
  Tipically, there are two overall categories when it comes to people and their learning.
  The categories are simply organized and unorganized. If you are a person who learns
  best in a structured environment or with specific needs or restrictions, you are more of
  a organized person. If you are a person who learns perfectly fine without order or can
  "make it work", you are more of a unorganized person.

  The tips on this page split into those two categories to help weed out the tips that
  we already know may not work well for you. This, however, does not mean you can't try
  the tips in the other column and it does not necessarily mean that the tips in the
  other column will not work.
